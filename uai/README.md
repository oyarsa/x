# uai

Repository for random scripts that I write over time.

Random Python things, which are collected in a single project and installed as package.
The project is maintained with uv and can be installed as a package, so each individual
script can be run as a standalone command.

## Installation

Requirements:
- Python 3.12
- uv, pipx or others

```bash
> git clone git@github.com:oyarsa/x.git
# Install with uv
> uv tool install --editable uai
# Or with pipx
> pipx install --editable uai
```

The scripts are available under the `uai` executable.
