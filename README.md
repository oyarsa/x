## Archive

These projects were moved somewhere else or deprecated, but I keep a copy of their last
version here.

- [asap-review](/asap-review/README.md): Merge files from papers in the ASAP-Review
  dataset into a single file. Moved to
  [oyarsa/paper-hypergraph](https://github.com/oyarsa/paper-hypergraph/)
- [s2orc](s2orc/README.md): Extract data from [Semantic Scholar's
  API](https://api.semanticscholar.org/api-docs/). Moved to

- [webster1913](webster1913/README.md): Search for terms in the Webster 1913 dictionary.
  Deprecated: I switched to using the CLI `dict` program (shipped with Linux and macOS).
  The relevant dictionary is GCIDE.
